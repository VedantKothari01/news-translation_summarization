# Multilingual News Translation & Summarization System

## Project Vision

Breaking down language barriers in news consumption through neural machine translation and abstractive summarization. This system enables users worldwide to access and comprehend international news in their native language, addressing the information asymmetry problem in multilingual content delivery.

## Problem Statement

In today's globalized world, critical information is published continuously across multiple languages, creating barriers for non-native speakers. Traditional translation tools are slow, lack context understanding, and don't provide condensed summaries. Our solution leverages transformer-based neural networks to provide real-time, context-aware translation and summarization.

## System Architecture

The pipeline consists of four main components:

1. **News Fetching** - Real-time article retrieval from NewsAPI
2. **Language Detection** - Statistical n-gram based language identification
3. **Neural Translation** - mBART-50 encoder-decoder transformer
4. **Abstractive Summarization** - BART-Large-CNN for condensing articles

## Deep Learning Models

### mBART-50 (Translation)

**Architecture**: Many-to-Many Multilingual Machine Translation
- **Parameters**: 610 million
- **Languages**: 50 language pairs
- **Training**: Denoising autoencoding on CC25 corpus (25 languages, 1TB text)
- **Mechanism**: 
  - Encoder: Bidirectional self-attention across source tokens
  - Decoder: Autoregressive generation with cross-attention to encoder
  - Beam search (k=5) for optimal translations

**Why mBART over traditional MT?**
- Zero-shot translation: Learned representations transfer across languages
- Fine-tuned on news domain: Better handling of proper nouns and technical terms
- Attention mechanisms capture long-range dependencies

### BART-Large-CNN (Summarization)

**Architecture**: Encoder-Decoder with Bidirectional Encoder
- **Parameters**: 406 million (12 encoder + 12 decoder layers)
- **Training**: Pretrained on text infilling + fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail
- **Approach**: Abstractive (generates new text) vs Extractive (selects existing)

**Abstractive Benefits**:
- Creates coherent paraphrases
- Compresses information intelligently
- Handles complex sentence structures
- Maintains temporal coherence

### Technical Details

**Attention Mechanism**: Multi-head self-attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

**Beam Search**: Maintains multiple hypotheses during decoding to find optimal translations

**Positional Encoding**: Adds sequence order information to enable parallel processing

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for GPU acceleration)
- Internet connection for model downloads (~3GB)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VedantKothari01/news-translation_summarization.git
cd news-translation_summarization
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure API keys:
Create a `.env` file:
```
NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hf_token_here
```
Get NewsAPI key from https://newsapi.org
Get HF token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

5. Run application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Guide

1. **Language Selection**: Choose target language from sidebar (15+ options)
2. **Category**: Select news category (technology, business, science, etc.)
3. **Refresh**: Click "Refresh News" to fetch latest articles
4. **Navigation**: Use Previous/Next buttons to browse articles
5. **Deep Dive**: Expand "Read Full Article" for complete translated content

### Performance Notes
- First run: Models download automatically (~5-10 minutes)
- Subsequent runs: Models cached in session (instant)
- Inference: ~2-5 seconds per article on CPU, ~1 second on GPU

## Model Selection Rationale

### Why mBART-50 over Google Translate API?
- **Privacy**: Local processing, no data leaves machine
- **Cost**: No API usage fees
- **Flexibility**: Fine-tunable on custom datasets
- **Research**: Full transparency into model architecture

### Why BART over extractive summarization?
- **Coherence**: Generates fluent summaries vs fragmented sentences
- **Compression**: Better information density
- **Quality**: Contextual understanding of article content

### Why Transformers over RNN/LSTM?
- **Speed**: Parallel processing vs sequential bottleneck
- **Long-range**: Better capture of dependencies across document
- **Transfer Learning**: Pretrained weights boost performance

## Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Memory Management**: Lazy loading of models to conserve RAM
2. **Caching**: Session state prevents redundant computations
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
4. **Multilingual Support**: Unified interface for 50+ language pairs
5. **Streamlit Limitations**: Efficient state management for complex pipelines

## Future Enhancements

- Fine-tuning on domain-specific corpora (finance, sports, tech)
- Attention visualization for model interpretability
- ROUGE/BLEU evaluation metrics
- Batch processing for multiple articles
- Custom model training interface
- Export to PDF/Word for offline reading
